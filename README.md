# Bit-fragmentation-
Bit fragmentation Encryption 
okay so my idea here was what if we can make bits smaller? like fragment bits and put them back together. For example Bits is either 0 or 1. what if we could create something that can split each 0 or each 1 into a window thats split in 4. say a ¼ of 0 or a ¼ of 1. each to its own it is indeed very unique. so having a ¼ of a Bit for "Bit Encryption". You always will distinguish those eight puzzles from one another. The 1 must just have a ( _ ) at its bottom for better distinction, in the "Bit encryption and decryption" process. Make any sense or should i draw a picture of it???  okay now for the fun part it has two options, we can either use hardware to refragment and defragment or we can go ahead and use software. this is also open source so please people as many people on this project as could be, lets get the community in on this and expand. who can perhaps reach out to Linus or Gates? or Shuttleworth?
